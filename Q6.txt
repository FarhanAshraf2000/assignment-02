#Question number 06:
 the number of data types supported by dart are 5 
 these are 
   Datatype       keyword
 number           int,double,num
 string           String
 Boolean          bool
 lists            List
 Maps             Map



1. Number: The number in Dart Programming is the data type that is used to hold the numeric value. Dart numbers can be classified as: 

   The int data type is used to represent whole numbers.
   The double data type is used to represent 64-bit floating-point numbers.
   The num type is an inherited data type of the int and double types.
example
void main() { 
 int a = 34;
 num b = 24.5;
 double c = 34.6;
  print ("$a\n$b\n$c");
}

2. String: It used to represent a sequence of characters.
   It is a sequence of UTF-16 code units. The keyword string is used to represent string literals.
   String values are embedded in either single or double-quotes.
example
void main() { 
 String a= "Farhan Ashraf";
  print(a);

}


3. Boolean: It represents Boolean values true and false. The keyword bool is used to represent a Boolean literal in DART. 
example
 
void main() {
  String str = 'Coding is '; 
  String str1 = 'Fun'; 
    
  bool val = (str==str1);
  print (val);  
}


4. List: List data type is similar to arrays in other programming languages. 
   A list is used to represent a collection of objects. It is an ordered group of objectsvoid main() 
{ 
    List gfg = ["farhan","ahsan","bilal"];
    
    
    print(gfg); 
    print(gfg[0]); 
} 
exmaple

5. Map: The Map object is a key and value pair. Keys and values on a map may be of any type. It is a dynamic collection. 
example
void main() 
{ 
   Map a = {2:"farhan",3:"biala",4:"ahsan"};
  print(a);
  print(a.keys);
  print(a.values);
}
